Problem:

    Consider there is a parent class - Vehicle

    abstract class Vehicle {
        Vehicle() {

        }

        void getGoing() {
            drive();
        }

        abstract void drive();
    }

    and multiple implementations of this abstract parent class namely -
    1. GoodsVehicle
    2. OffRoadVehicle
    3. SportsVehicle
    4. SedanVehicle
    ...


    Here, GoodsVehicle and SedanVehicle would have the same implementation of the drive() method,
    and OffRoadVehicle and SportsVehicle would have similar implementations.

    This would lead to duplicate code.


Solution:

    Since the implementations of the drive() method are common across classes,
    the logic can be extracted out and put into classes a.k.a strategy classes,
    and hence can be used with the Vehicle class implementations / child classes.
